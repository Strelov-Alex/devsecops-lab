# DevSecOps Lab

Welcome to my DevSecOps Lab — a structured, hands-on journey into the world of Linux, cybersecurity, automation, and infrastructure engineering.

This repository documents my daily practice as I build real-world skills in:

- 🐧 Linux command-line proficiency  
- ⚙️ Shell scripting and automation  
- 🔐 System hardening & cybersecurity principles  
- 🌐 Networking & process monitoring  
- 🧪 DevOps tools and infrastructure fundamentals  
- 📦 Version control with Git & GitHub

## 🌱 Why this repo?

I'm not just learning commands — I'm building **habits, reflexes, and systems thinking** to become a world-class DevSecOps and InfoSec professional.

This repository serves as:

- My **daily training journal**
- A growing archive of lessons, scripts, configs, and notes
- A visible timeline of my personal and technical growth

## 🔄 Automation

The log folder is automatically updated daily with recent commands via a cron job. This simulates real-world system logging and versioned accountability.

## 🧠 My Goal

To master the foundations that drive secure, automated, and scalable systems — and to build a solid foundation for a career in DevSecOps, ethical hacking, or infrastructure engineering.
